		In this we are going to learn about namespaces in this file.
		Namespaces : They help us to organise our code. Example suppose i have 2 teams working on a project and
		they are working on 2 different things - TeamA and TeamB. So i want to distinguish that which class is 
		made by which team. With the help of namespaces i can do that easily.

		For example Console class comes from the System namespace which is used to print something on the console.
		A namespace is nothing but just something that holds up various classes.
		A namespace can contain:
		a) namespace
		b) classes
		c) interface
		d) enums
		e) struct
		f) delegate.

		This is a little complex topic we will learn it slowly by time. Thus i am not adding anything in the main method.
