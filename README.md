# C-sharp-concepts
This repository contains various code files to learn c sharp in structured manner.

## Naming conventions<br>
1. Pascal case for method names and classes -> HelloHemant<br>
2. Camel case for variable names and method parameters -> thisIsVariable<br>
3. Use prefix I for interface names -> IMyInterface<br>
4. Use meaningful descriptive words to name variables.<br>
5. Avoid using single character varibles like i instead use something like index.<br>
6. Avoid using underscore in local varible names.<br>
